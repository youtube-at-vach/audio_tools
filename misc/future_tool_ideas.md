# Future Audio Measurement Tool Ideas

This document lists potential ideas for future audio measurement programs. These suggestions are based on what might be necessary or useful for a comprehensive audio analysis toolkit, without immediate regard for implementation feasibility.

## Potential Future Tools:

-   **SINAD (Signal-to-Noise and Distortion) Analyzer**:
    Measures SINAD, a key performance metric for ADCs/DACs combining SNR and THD+N. (Basic SINAD calculation now implemented in `audio_analyzer/` as of 2024-10-18 by Jules. This idea could be expanded for more dedicated analysis if needed.)

-   **Dynamic Range (DR) Measurement Tool (Advanced)**:
    Measures dynamic range, potentially adhering to standards like AES17, using specific test signals and weighting.

-   **Loudness Meter (LUFS/LKFS)**:
    Measures perceived loudness according to standards like EBU R128 / ITU-R BS.1770, crucial for mastering and broadcast. (Implemented in `lufs_meter/`)

-   **Stereo Width/Imaging Analyzer**:
    Analyzes characteristics of a stereo image beyond basic phase/crosstalk, such as perceived width or inter-channel coherence.

-   **Wow and Flutter Analyzer**:
    Measures speed variations in analog playback systems like turntables or tape decks, using a stable test tone recording. (Implemented in `wow_flutter_analyzer/`)

-   **Reverberation Time (RT60) Analyzer**:
    Measures reverberation time (e.g., RT60) in an acoustic space, typically using an impulse response or interrupted noise. (Implemented in `rt60_analyzer/`)

-   **Automated Test Sequencer**:
    A higher-level tool to run a predefined sequence of existing analyzer tools and compile a combined report for comprehensive device testing.

-   **Automated Loopback Path Finder/Tester**:
    A utility that attempts to automatically detect viable audio loopback paths between output and input channels on a selected audio device. This could simplify the setup process for other measurement tools by identifying which channel combinations form a closed loop, perhaps by sending a specific test signal and scanning inputs for its presence. (Implemented in `audio_loopback_finder/`)

-   **Audio Interface Calibration Utility**:
    A guided tool to help users create basic calibration profiles for their audio interfaces. This could involve:
    - Measuring a known external hardware calibrator.
    - Performing a loopback test and assuming a nominally flat response to store relative gain differences between channels or frequency response deviations.
    - Stored correction factors (e.g., gain offsets, basic EQ curves) could then be optionally applied by other analysis tools to improve measurement accuracy.

-   **Enhanced Distortion Analyzer Suite**:
    Building upon or complementing existing distortion tools, this suite could offer:
    - Detailed THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) analysis, including THD vs. frequency sweeps and THD vs. amplitude sweeps.
    - Broader coverage of IMD (Intermodulation Distortion) test standards (e.g., DIN, CCIF, SMPTE) with more detailed reporting of individual distortion products.
    - Potentially, analysis of specific harmonic components (H2, H3, etc.).

-   **LUFS Test Signal Generator**:
    A tool to generate standardized audio test signals specifically designed for calibrating and verifying LUFS meters (e.g., signals specified in EBU R128 s1 or ITU-R BS.1771, such as a -23 LUFS sine wave, or specific noise signals).

-   **Real-time Multi-Loudness Monitor**:
    An advanced real-time loudness monitor that displays Momentary, Short-term, and Integrated LUFS simultaneously, possibly with a graphical history, for continuous audio stream analysis (e.g., live broadcast feed, DAW output via virtual soundcard). Would require robust handling of audio device input and continuous processing.

-   **Batch Audio File Loudness Normalizer**:
    A utility to process multiple audio files (e.g., from a directory), measure their integrated loudness using the `lufs_meter` logic, and then optionally adjust their gain to meet a user-specified target LUFS level. This would be useful for normalizing a library of audio tracks or ensuring consistent loudness for a playlist. Output could be new files or modification in-place (with warnings).

-   **Advanced SINAD/Distortion Plotter**:
    While `audio_analyzer` calculates SINAD, THD, THD+N, this tool would offer dedicated visualization. It could generate plots like SINAD vs. Frequency, SINAD vs. Amplitude, THD vs. Frequency/Amplitude, and individual harmonic levels vs. frequency/amplitude, potentially using data from `audio_analyzer`'s sweep modes but with enhanced graphing capabilities.

-   **Noise Figure (NF) Analyzer**:
    Measures the Noise Figure (NF) of an audio device. NF quantifies SNR degradation by components. This would likely require specific methodologies like the Y-factor method using a calibrated noise source or a two-stage measurement, providing deeper noise analysis than basic SNR.

-   **Automated Audio Test Report Generator**:
    Acts as a test executive. Users could define a sequence of existing analyzer tools (e.g., `audio_freq_response_analyzer`, `audio_analyzer`) to run on a DUT. The tool would execute tests, collect results/plots, and compile a comprehensive report (e.g., HTML, PDF, Markdown), building on the "Automated Test Sequencer" idea with a strong reporting focus.

-   **Real-time Harmonic Distortion Analyzer with Loopback Correction**:
    This tool aims to measure the true harmonic distortion of an audio device by actively compensating for the distortion introduced by the playback loopback path. It would involve:
    1.  Generating a test signal (e.g., a pure sine wave).
    2.  Playing it through the device under test (DUT) and simultaneously recording the output.
    3.  Analyzing the recorded signal to identify harmonic components.
    4.  Crucially, generating a real-time "anti-harmonic" signal (inverse phase and amplitude of detected harmonics) and mixing it with the original test signal before playback.
    5.  Iteratively adjusting the anti-harmonic signal to minimize the detected harmonics in the recorded signal, effectively "nulling out" the loopback distortion.
    6.  The remaining distortion would then represent the true distortion of the DUT.
    This is a technically challenging feature requiring precise real-time audio processing, low-latency audio I/O, and robust adaptive filtering algorithms. Implementation should be considered once the technical feasibility and required computational resources are thoroughly assessed.
