# Future Audio Measurement Tool Ideas

This document lists potential ideas for future audio measurement programs. These suggestions are based on what might be necessary or useful for a comprehensive audio analysis toolkit, without immediate regard for implementation feasibility.

## Potential Future Tools:

-   **SINAD (Signal-to-Noise and Distortion) Analyzer**:
    Measures SINAD, a key performance metric for ADCs/DACs combining SNR and THD+N. (Basic SINAD calculation now implemented in `audio_analyzer/` as of 2024-10-18 by Jules. This idea could be expanded for more dedicated analysis if needed.)

-   **Dynamic Range (DR) Measurement Tool (Advanced)**:
    Measures dynamic range, potentially adhering to standards like AES17, using specific test signals and weighting.

-   **Loudness Meter (LUFS/LKFS)**:
    Measures perceived loudness according to standards like EBU R128 / ITU-R BS.1770, crucial for mastering and broadcast. (Implemented in `lufs_meter/`)

-   **Stereo Width/Imaging Analyzer**:
    Analyzes characteristics of a stereo image beyond basic phase/crosstalk, such as perceived width or inter-channel coherence.

-   **Wow and Flutter Analyzer**:
    Measures speed variations in analog playback systems like turntables or tape decks, using a stable test tone recording.

-   **Reverberation Time (RT60) Analyzer**:
    Measures reverberation time (e.g., RT60) in an acoustic space, typically using an impulse response or interrupted noise.

-   **Automated Test Sequencer**:
    A higher-level tool to run a predefined sequence of existing analyzer tools and compile a combined report for comprehensive device testing.

-   **Automated Loopback Path Finder/Tester**:
    A utility that attempts to automatically detect viable audio loopback paths between output and input channels on a selected audio device. This could simplify the setup process for other measurement tools by identifying which channel combinations form a closed loop, perhaps by sending a specific test signal and scanning inputs for its presence.

-   **Audio Interface Calibration Utility**:
    A guided tool to help users create basic calibration profiles for their audio interfaces. This could involve:
    - Measuring a known external hardware calibrator.
    - Performing a loopback test and assuming a nominally flat response to store relative gain differences between channels or frequency response deviations.
    - Stored correction factors (e.g., gain offsets, basic EQ curves) could then be optionally applied by other analysis tools to improve measurement accuracy.

-   **Enhanced Distortion Analyzer Suite**:
    Building upon or complementing existing distortion tools, this suite could offer:
    - Detailed THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) analysis, including THD vs. frequency sweeps and THD vs. amplitude sweeps.
    - Broader coverage of IMD (Intermodulation Distortion) test standards (e.g., DIN, CCIF, SMPTE) with more detailed reporting of individual distortion products.
    - Potentially, analysis of specific harmonic components (H2, H3, etc.).

-   **LUFS Test Signal Generator**:
    A tool to generate standardized audio test signals specifically designed for calibrating and verifying LUFS meters (e.g., signals specified in EBU R128 s1 or ITU-R BS.1771, such as a -23 LUFS sine wave, or specific noise signals).

-   **Real-time Multi-Loudness Monitor**:
    An advanced real-time loudness monitor that displays Momentary, Short-term, and Integrated LUFS simultaneously, possibly with a graphical history, for continuous audio stream analysis (e.g., live broadcast feed, DAW output via virtual soundcard). Would require robust handling of audio device input and continuous processing.

-   **Batch Audio File Loudness Normalizer**:
    A utility to process multiple audio files (e.g., from a directory), measure their integrated loudness using the `lufs_meter` logic, and then optionally adjust their gain to meet a user-specified target LUFS level. This would be useful for normalizing a library of audio tracks or ensuring consistent loudness for a playlist. Output could be new files or modification in-place (with warnings).

-   **Advanced SINAD/Distortion Plotter**:
    While `audio_analyzer` calculates SINAD, THD, THD+N, this tool would offer dedicated visualization. It could generate plots like SINAD vs. Frequency, SINAD vs. Amplitude, THD vs. Frequency/Amplitude, and individual harmonic levels vs. frequency/amplitude, potentially using data from `audio_analyzer`'s sweep modes but with enhanced graphing capabilities.

-   **Noise Figure (NF) Analyzer**:
    Measures the Noise Figure (NF) of an audio device. NF quantifies SNR degradation by components. This would likely require specific methodologies like the Y-factor method using a calibrated noise source or a two-stage measurement, providing deeper noise analysis than basic SNR.

-   **Automated Audio Test Report Generator**:
    Acts as a test executive. Users could define a sequence of existing analyzer tools (e.g., `audio_freq_response_analyzer`, `audio_analyzer`) to run on a DUT. The tool would execute tests, collect results/plots, and compile a comprehensive report (e.g., HTML, PDF, Markdown), building on the "Automated Test Sequencer" idea with a strong reporting focus.

-   **Advanced Wow and Flutter Standards Analyzer**:
    Building upon the existing Wow and Flutter Analyzer, this tool would offer:
    *   Implementation of more specific international measurement standards (e.g., AES6-2008, IEC-60386, JIS C5551), including precise definitions for weighting filters and measurement techniques if they differ significantly from the current DIN-like implementation.
    *   Detailed spectral analysis of the demodulated frequency variations to identify discrete wow or flutter frequencies and their amplitudes.
    *   Measurement of flutter sidebands around the test tone.
    *   Long-term speed drift and stability analysis with more sophisticated trend removal.

-   **Playback Speed Calibration Assistant**:
    An interactive tool to help users calibrate the playback speed of analog systems like turntables or tape decks.
    *   Requires a known reference frequency test tone recording.
    *   Provides real-time feedback on the measured average frequency deviation from the reference (e.g., as a percentage or cents).
    *   Could offer a graphical display showing the frequency drift over a short window to help fine-tune speed adjustments.
    *   Could log calibration history or changes.

-   **Test Tone Quality Analyzer**:
    A utility to analyze the quality of a recorded test tone *before* it's used for device-under-test measurements. This helps differentiate issues in the test signal from issues in the playback device.
    *   Measures frequency stability and purity of the tone itself.
    *   Calculates THD and SNR of the recorded tone.
    *   Verifies amplitude stability.
    *   Could identify if a test tone recording has pre-existing wow/flutter artifacts from the recording equipment or cutting lathe.

-   **Measurement Input Pre-flight Check Utility**:
    A general-purpose utility that could be run before other analyzers to check basic signal validity for measurement tasks.
    *   Detects silence or very low signal levels.
    *   Checks for clipping or excessive DC offset.
    *   Provides a basic spectral overview to confirm the primary tone/signal is present and not overwhelmed by noise.
    *   Estimates primary frequency to suggest if it's suitable for the intended `ref_freq` of another tool.
    *   This could help users diagnose why a measurement tool might be producing unexpected results or warnings by first validating the input signal itself.
