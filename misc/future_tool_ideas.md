# Future Audio Measurement Tool Ideas

This document lists potential ideas for future audio measurement programs. These suggestions are based on what might be necessary or useful for a comprehensive audio analysis toolkit, without immediate regard for implementation feasibility.

## Potential Future Tools:

-   **SINAD (Signal-to-Noise and Distortion) Analyzer**:
    Measures SINAD, a key performance metric for ADCs/DACs combining SNR and THD+N.

-   **Dynamic Range (DR) Measurement Tool (Advanced)**:
    Measures dynamic range, potentially adhering to standards like AES17, using specific test signals and weighting.

-   **Loudness Meter (LUFS/LKFS)**:
    Measures perceived loudness according to standards like EBU R128 / ITU-R BS.1770, crucial for mastering and broadcast.

-   **Stereo Width/Imaging Analyzer**:
    Analyzes characteristics of a stereo image beyond basic phase/crosstalk, such as perceived width or inter-channel coherence.

-   **Wow and Flutter Analyzer**:
    Measures speed variations in analog playback systems like turntables or tape decks, using a stable test tone recording.

-   **Reverberation Time (RT60) Analyzer**:
    Measures reverberation time (e.g., RT60) in an acoustic space, typically using an impulse response or interrupted noise.

-   **Automated Test Sequencer**:
    A higher-level tool to run a predefined sequence of existing analyzer tools and compile a combined report for comprehensive device testing.
