# Future Audio Measurement Tool Ideas

This document lists potential ideas for future audio measurement programs. These suggestions are based on what might be necessary or useful for a comprehensive audio analysis toolkit, without immediate regard for implementation feasibility.

## Potential Future Tools:

-   **SINAD (Signal-to-Noise and Distortion) Analyzer**:
    Measures SINAD, a key performance metric for ADCs/DACs combining SNR and THD+N.

-   **Dynamic Range (DR) Measurement Tool (Advanced)**:
    Measures dynamic range, potentially adhering to standards like AES17, using specific test signals and weighting.

-   **Loudness Meter (LUFS/LKFS)**:
    Measures perceived loudness according to standards like EBU R128 / ITU-R BS.1770, crucial for mastering and broadcast.

-   **Stereo Width/Imaging Analyzer**:
    Analyzes characteristics of a stereo image beyond basic phase/crosstalk, such as perceived width or inter-channel coherence.

-   **Wow and Flutter Analyzer**:
    Measures speed variations in analog playback systems like turntables or tape decks, using a stable test tone recording.

-   **Reverberation Time (RT60) Analyzer**:
    Measures reverberation time (e.g., RT60) in an acoustic space, typically using an impulse response or interrupted noise.

-   **Automated Test Sequencer**:
    A higher-level tool to run a predefined sequence of existing analyzer tools and compile a combined report for comprehensive device testing.

-   **Automated Loopback Path Finder/Tester**:
    A utility that attempts to automatically detect viable audio loopback paths between output and input channels on a selected audio device. This could simplify the setup process for other measurement tools by identifying which channel combinations form a closed loop, perhaps by sending a specific test signal and scanning inputs for its presence.

-   **Audio Interface Calibration Utility**:
    A guided tool to help users create basic calibration profiles for their audio interfaces. This could involve:
    - Measuring a known external hardware calibrator.
    - Performing a loopback test and assuming a nominally flat response to store relative gain differences between channels or frequency response deviations.
    - Stored correction factors (e.g., gain offsets, basic EQ curves) could then be optionally applied by other analysis tools to improve measurement accuracy.

-   **Enhanced Distortion Analyzer Suite**:
    Building upon or complementing existing distortion tools, this suite could offer:
    - Detailed THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) analysis, including THD vs. frequency sweeps and THD vs. amplitude sweeps.
    - Broader coverage of IMD (Intermodulation Distortion) test standards (e.g., DIN, CCIF, SMPTE) with more detailed reporting of individual distortion products.
    - Potentially, analysis of specific harmonic components (H2, H3, etc.).
