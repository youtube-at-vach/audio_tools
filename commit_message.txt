feat: Add unweighted dynamic range analyzer

This commit introduces a new tool for measuring the unweighted dynamic range of audio devices.
It uses a -60 dBFS test tone and an FFT-based method to remove the tone,
then calculates the RMS of the residual noise floor.

Also, updated `temp_procedure_doc.md` with insights gained during development,
specifically regarding filter selection (IIR vs. FFT for tone removal) and
the complexities of implementing standard weighting filters.
