# Legacy Audio Measurement Tools

This document summarizes the audio measurement tools located in the `legacy` directory. Each tool is listed with a brief description of its purpose.

## Tool List

*   **audio_analyzer**: Performs various audio analyses, including distortion visualization and audio calculation.
*   **audio_calibration_tool**: Calibrates audio devices to ensure accurate measurements.
*   **audio_crosstalk_analyzer**: Measures the amount of signal leakage between audio channels (crosstalk).
*   **audio_freq_response_analyzer**: Analyzes the frequency response of an audio system.
*   **audio_imd_analyzer**: Measures Intermodulation Distortion (IMD) in audio signals.
*   **audio_lissajous_analyzer**: Visualizes the phase and frequency relationship between two audio signals using Lissajous figures.
*   **audio_loopback_finder**: Detects and identifies available audio loopback devices on the system.
*   **audio_phase_analyzer**: Measures the phase difference between audio signals.
*   **audio_signal_generator**: Generates various types of audio signals for testing purposes.
*   **audio_transient_analyzer**: Analyzes transient signals and events in audio recordings.
*   **dynamic_range_analyzer**: Measures the dynamic range of an audio system.
*   **lufs_meter**: Measures the perceived loudness of audio material in LUFS (Loudness Units Full Scale).
*   **misc**: Contains miscellaneous scripts and ideas for future tools.
*   **noise_generator**: Generates different types of noise signals (e.g., white noise, pink noise).
*   **noise_spectrum_analyzer**: Analyzes the frequency spectrum of noise signals.
*   **rt60_analyzer**: Measures the reverberation time (RT60) of a room or acoustic space.
*   **snr_analyzer**: Measures the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of an audio signal.
*   **wow_flutter_analyzer**: Measures the wow and flutter, which are fluctuations in pitch, in audio playback systems.
